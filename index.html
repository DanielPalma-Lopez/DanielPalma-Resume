        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Daniel Palma-Lopez, currently I am a Theatre, Film, and Digital Production major at the University of California, Riverside. I am also a Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Program committee member.<br><br>

        Before College I went to Palmdale high school in Palmdale, CA. While there I had several jobs, the most recent one was a lifeguard at a local water park named Dry Town that was publicly owned by the city. This was my second time being a lifeguard, the first time was also at a local business, Antelope Valley Country Club. I worked at each place for about a year and I am technically still employed by at Dry Town, but it is only open during the summer. I had similar responsibilities at each place, my job was to enforce the rules set in place for the pool/attraction that I was in charge for the day. I had to make sure everyone was following these rules, by doing this, I was fulfilling my primary responsiblity of each job, and that was making sure everyone was being safe and no one was in any danger. If someone was in danger, it was also my job to either save them from drowning, or give them some kind of first aid. One thing that I had to do at the country club that I did not have to do at the the water park was do low-level maintenance on the pool, such as cleaning it or checking the pH levels of the water and making sure it was safe to swim in.<br><br>

        I have also worked at a local Finish Line in the Antelope Valley mall too. There I was a great salesperson, I was very helpful with customers and always had a good attitutde, I usually met my daily sales goal and I always helped out my fellow coworkers. On slower days I kept myself busy by fixing the shoes on the walls or cleaning and sanitizing the areas around the store that were often intercted with like door handles and benches and such. I have also worked with my dad doing contstruction to people's homes. We would do lots of yardwork and we would work with cement a lot too. We put up walls and did electrical work as well. My dad does not specialize in one thing, he offers all kinds of services to people, so when I would work with him, I would often find myself doing very different things between jobs.
